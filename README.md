# Predicting Factors Influencing Future Career Choices in the Faculty of Digital Arts and Science

## Overview

This research project focuses on the study of data mining techniques to predict factors influencing career choices among students in the Faculty of Digital Arts and Science. The primary objective is to identify the various dimensions that play a role in students' career decisions. The study aims to provide insights into factors relevant to career selection, assisting students in making informed decisions and guiding the development of teaching methodologies aligned with professional needs.

## Program Used: Weka

[Weka](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) is employed as the primary tool for implementing data mining techniques in this research. The analysis compares the efficiency of two analytical approaches: Decision Trees and K-Nearest Neighbors.

## Research Objectives

1. **Explore Multidimensional Factors:** Investigate and compare the efficiency of decision-making models by analyzing trends in students' responses to career-related factors.

2. **Model Comparison:** Evaluate and compare the accuracy of two predictive modeling techniquesâ€”Decision Trees and K-Nearest Neighbors.

3. **Inform Decision-Making:** Provide insights into the factors influencing students' career choices and use this information to guide decision-making processes.

## Methodology

The research utilizes two data mining techniques: Decision Trees and K-Nearest Neighbors. The Decision Trees model employs the Random Forest algorithm, yielding the highest accuracy with a precision of 58.08%, recall of 56.30%, precision of 58.10%, and balanced accuracy of 56.70%. In comparison, the K-Nearest Neighbors model, using the IBk algorithm, achieves an accuracy of 56.90%, precision of 56.60%, recall of 56.90%, and balanced accuracy of 56.30%. Additionally, a Decision Trees model with the J48 algorithm provides the lowest accuracy, with a precision of 55.39%, recall of 54.60%, precision of 55.40%, and balanced accuracy of 54.80%.

## Implications and Application

The research outcomes offer valuable insights for:

- **Student Decision-Making:** Helping students make informed decisions about their careers based on identified influential factors.
  
- **Teaching Methodologies:** Guiding the development of teaching methodologies tailored to meet the professional needs identified through data analysis.

## Conclusion

The findings from this research provide a foundation for implementing tailored teaching approaches and aiding students in making well-informed career choices. The comparative analysis of Decision Trees and K-Nearest Neighbors models contributes to the understanding of predictive modeling in the context of career decision-making.
